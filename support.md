## Frequently Asked Questions

### How does MIGO get weather data?
MIGO uses Apple’s WeatherKit to provide current conditions, hourly forecasts, and daily outlooks. Data is localized to your device’s location or to cities you choose.

### Why does the app ask for location access?
Location is used to deliver accurate, local forecasts. You can:
- Allow location access for your current position, or
- Disable location and manually select cities.

MIGO does not store or share your location.

### What do the “feels like” indicators mean?
MIGO blends temperature, wind, humidity, and other factors to show how conditions may actually feel outdoors, not just the reported air temperature. This helps with planning clothing and activities.

### Does MIGO work without an internet connection?
An internet connection is required to fetch updated weather data. Previously loaded forecasts may remain visible for a short time, but accuracy cannot be guaranteed offline.

## Troubleshooting
