## Clothing Sliders

- These sliders declare the maximum temperature that the clothing item is needed for. For example, if Sweater is set to 60 degF, then if the temperature is above 60 degF the app will not suggest a sweater is needed.
- The sliders are chained together, so that they can't overlap each other.
- Each clothing item shows a range of temperatures from the clothing item below, to the current clothing item.
---
Example to illustrate how to use these clothing sliders:
 - Start out with the default values
 - If you're going out for a walk, set the Activity selector (at the top of the Hourly tab) to Walking
 - Imagine that the app suggests that you should be wearing a jacket and turtleneck
 - Walk for atleast 5 minutes and then decide if you're too hot or too cold. If you're too cold then bump the jacket slider up a few degrees. You may not get this right the first time, but that is what "tuning" is all about. Over time, you'll find the right setting for your metabolism and your particular jacket (my jackets are pretty warm, yours might be thinner).
 - Over the different seasons, you'll repeat this each time there is a different clothing item suggested (ie. Frigid for heavy coat, coat, jacket, sweater, and long sleeved t-shirt).
 - Once it's tuned for you, the app will always suggest the appropriate clothing for any temperature, wind, cloud cover, day/night conditions.

The **Dew Point slider** in the Miscellaneous section (below the clothing sliders) is used to set the dew point temperature that feels sticky to you. This is typically somewhat subjective, but generally the value is between 55-65 degF. When you set this for you, the Sun icon in the Hourly tab (2nd column from left) will show an orange dew drop over the Sun for any hour where the dew point temperature is above this slider value.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can this app work when there is wind?
That app takes many conditions into account for each hour. It even takes your activity level (sitting, walking, bike riding) into account. However, if you walk in a loop, then part of the time the wind is in yoru face (effectively higher wind speed) and sometimes behind you (effectively lower wind speed). So, the app won't be perfect for the entire walk. But, it's pretty close, and since most of the clothing items can be layered, you should error on the more-clothes side and take off a layer (or open a jacket/coat) if needed.

### Why does the app ask for location access?
Location is used to deliver accurate, local forecasts. You can:
- Allow location access for your current position, or
- Disable location and manually select cities.

MIGO does not store or share your location.

### What do the “feels like” indicators mean?
MIGO blends temperature, wind, humidity, and other factors to show how conditions may actually feel outdoors, not just the reported air temperature. This helps with planning clothing and activities.

### Does MIGO work without an internet connection?
An internet connection is required to fetch updated weather data. Previously loaded forecasts may remain visible for a short time, but accuracy cannot be guaranteed offline.

## Troubleshooting

### The forecast is not updating
- Confirm you have an active internet connection.
- Pull to refresh (if available) or restart the app.
- Make sure Location Services are enabled if you rely on automatic location.

### Location seems incorrect

### The app appears unresponsive or crashes
- Force close the app and reopen it.
