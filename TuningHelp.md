## Clothes vs Temperature Sliders
- These sliders declare the maximum temperature that the clothing item is needed for. For example, if Sweater is set to 60 degF, then if the temperature is above 60 degF the app will not suggest a sweater is needed.
- The sliders are chained together, so that they can't overlap each other.
- Each clothing item shows a range of temperatures from the clothing item below, to the current clothing item.
- Back one level in Settings there is a **"personal thermostat" slider**. If you don't want to mess with tuning the app for your clothing you can just use this slider. If you find you're too cold when you are outdoors, then bump this slider up a few degrees. This is also handy if you're fighting illness and just need to be a bit warmer some days.

### Example to illustrate how to use these clothing sliders:
 - Start out with the default values
 - If you're going out for a walk, set the Activity selector (at the top of the Hourly tab) to Walking

 - Imagine that the app suggests that you should be wearing a jacket and turtleneck
 - Walk for atleast 5 minutes and then decide if you're too hot or too cold. If you're too cold then bump the jacket slider up a few degrees. You may not get this right the first time, but that is what "tuning" is all about. Over time, you'll find the right setting for your metabolism and your particular jacket (my jackets are pretty warm, yours might be thinner).
 - Over the different seasons, you'll repeat this each time there is a different clothing item suggested (ie. Frigid for heavy coat, coat, jacket, sweater, and long sleeved t-shirt).
 - Once it's tuned for you, the app will always suggest the appropriate clothing for any temperature, wind, cloud cover, day/night conditions.

The **Dew Point slider** in the Miscellaneous section (below the clothing sliders) is used to set the dew point temperature that feels sticky to you. This is typically somewhat subjective, but generally the value is between 55-65 degF. When you set this for you, the Sun icon in the Hourly tab (2nd column from left) will show an orange dew drop over the Sun for any hour where the dew point temperature is above this slider value:

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can this app work when there is wind?
The app takes many conditions into account for each hour. It even takes your activity level (sitting, walking, bike riding) into account. However, if you walk in a loop, then part of the time the wind is in your face (effectively higher wind speed) and sometimes behind you (effectively lower wind speed). So, the app won't be perfect for the entire walk. But, it's pretty close, and since most of the clothing items can be layered, you should initially error on the more-clothes side and take off a layer (or open a jacket/coat) if needed.

### My jacket is thinner than the jacket pictured. How do I handle this?
You just have to tune the app for your particular jacket type. If you have some thin jackets and some heavier, then you might want to consider your thinner jackets equivalent to sweaters; and tune the app to your thicker jackets.

### One day the app was perfect, and the next day the suggestion was too warm (or too cold)?
Yes, this can happen from time to time. Weather forecasts are not perfect. However, over the last ten years the weather forecasting has gotten much more accurate. Also, unitl you get the app tuned for you, you might want to error on the more-clothes side with the idea that you can always shed a layer or open a top level to cool down.

Another potential problem occurs when the app can't find your location and defaults to a different location. Now the reported weather is not your weather and therefore the suggested clothing may be wrong. The hourly tab always reports the location used for the weather, so make sure this is correct. If not, you can go to the app's setting tab; then to "Manage Cities" page and tap the "Use Current Location" button.

### I'm just walking to class... is that considered a walking activity?
No. If you're just walking to class, or doing a slow walk of the dogs, that's not "walking" activity. That's more similar to the "Sitting" activity level. By "Walking" the app is assuming you're out for atleast a 15 minute walk without stopping to smell the roses.

### I went for a hike in the hills and the app had me wearing way too much clothes.
Yes, if you're a hiker or serious biker, this app will not be correct. Those are very high levels of activity and require specialized clothing in cold weather.

## The four columns of the Hourly Tab:

### What are the four columns in the Hourly tab?
There is an hourly row for the next 48 hours.
 - The **first column (left to right)** shows the time of day, sunrise/sunset, and the temperature.
 - **The second column** is a representation of the Sun or Moon (with moon phase). There are multiple layers:
    - **Blue vertical lines** along the bottom indicates chance of precipitation... more lines, higher chance of precipitation. If the chance is moderately high then a **closed umbrella** appears to say you might want to bring an umbrella. An **open umbrella with rain drops** indicates that rain is very likely. If the temperature is low enough then the word **"Snow" with "chance" or "likely"** will appear.
   - **White horizontal lines** stacked on the right side indicate the wind speed... more lines, higher speed
   - Other overlays: **Frost** or **Dew** will appear to let you know that you might have to scrape the car's windshield, or your toes will get wet if you go out with bare feet. An **Orange dew drop** indicates sticky air conditions (high dew point temperature). A **blue ice cube** indicates that the temperature will be below freezing, so be cautious around potentially wet surfaces.
   - **See-thru gray**, growing up from the bottom indicates amount of cloud cover 
 - **The third column** shows the recommended clothing. It's nice to have this for each hour so you can plan what to wear based on when you'll be outside. Note that for many times of year, the recommended clothing changes dramatically through the day.
 - **The fourth column** wind and air related conditions:
   - A beanie or ball cap
   - Thin or thick gloves
   - A scarf
   - The wind sock is another visual cue about wind. The sock might be limp, sligtly filling, more full, full and finally bending the pole if extremely windy.
   - A silver lightning bolt indicates that the air is dry enough that you could experience static shock.
