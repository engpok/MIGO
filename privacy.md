# Calenduuh — Privacy Policy
_Last updated: December 2025_

Thank you for using **Calenduuh**. This privacy policy applies to both **Calenduuh Free** and the paid version of **Calenduuh** for macOS.

Calenduuh is designed with privacy as a core principle. The app stores all information **locally on your Mac**, and does not collect, transmit, or share any personal data with anyone.

Calenduuh does **not** collect, track, store, transmit, or share any of the following:

- Names or contact information  
- Email addresses

- Notes  
- Images embedded in notes (RTFD format)

## 🔒 Data Sharing

Calenduuh shares **no data** with third parties.

There are:

- No analytics SDKs

## 🌐 Internet Access

Calenduuh does **not** require an internet connection and does **not** access the internet for any feature.

The only exception is if you manually open a support or help webpage in your browser.

---

## 🧒 Children’s Privacy

Calenduuh does not collect any personal information, and is suitable for users of all ages, including children.

---

## 🧩 Data Export

If you use the Export feature, Calenduuh generates:

- A CSV file containing appointments  
- A ZIP file containing any notes with embedded images  

The CSV file is stored **only where you choose to save it**.  
The Zip file is not intended for editing by the user and therefore is stored in the app support folder according to Apple's sandbox requirements
Calenduuh does not upload, transmit, or send exported data anywhere.
